## 🧠 Overview

**Tourmate** is a personalized tourist place recommendation system that leverages multiple user-specific factors to generate intelligent suggestions for travel destinations. The system combines machine learning algorithms with contextual preferences to deliver recommendations that are tailored, efficient, and adaptable.

The project aims to enhance tourism experiences by understanding user behavior, location, seasonality, travel group type, and historical data.
